                            <h4>By Yisak Girmay, Jun 27, 2020</h4>
                            <p>The cloud computing landscape has been revolutionized by the advent of serverless
                                architectures, and AWS Lambda stands at the forefront of this paradigm shift. By
                                allowing developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers, Lambda has
                                redefined the way we build and deploy applications, offering unparalleled scalability,
                                cost-efficiency, and agility.

                                At its core, AWS Lambda is an event-driven compute service that executes your code in
                                response to triggers from various AWS services or custom events. This serverless
                                approach eliminates the need for managing infrastructure, enabling you to focus solely
                                on writing and deploying code. Lambda automatically scales your application based on
                                incoming requests, ensuring optimal resource utilization and minimizing idle capacity.

                                One of the key advantages of Lambda is its seamless integration with other AWS services.

                            <h3><a href="">Architecting Highly Available and Fault-Tolerant Applications with AWS</a>
                            </h3>
                            <h4>By Yisak Girmay, Oct 1, 2024</h4>
                            <p>In the world of cloud computing, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance is
                                paramount for mission-critical applications. AWS provides a robust set of services and
                                architectural patterns that enable developers and architects to build resilient and
                                highly available systems, minimizing downtime and maximizing operational efficiency.

                                At the heart of AWS's high availability offerings lies the concept of multiple
                                Availability Zones (AZs). Each AWS region comprises multiple AZs, which are physically
                                separate data centers designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs. By
                                distributing your application components across multiple AZs, you can achieve fault
                                tolerance and high availability, as even if one AZ experiences an outage, your
                                application can continue to operate seamlessly.

                                One of the key services that enables high availability on AWS is Amazon Elastic Load
                                Balancing (ELB). ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2
                                instances or containerized applications, ensuring that if one instance fails, traffic is
                                automatically rerouted to healthy instances. Additionally, ELB can be configured to span
                                multiple AZs, further enhancing fault tolerance and availability.

                                AWS also offers managed database services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service
                                (RDS) and Amazon Aurora, which provide built-in features for high availability and
                                replication. With these services, you can easily set up multi-AZ deployments, where a
                                standby replica is automatically provisioned in a separate AZ, ready to take over in
                                case of a primary instance failure.

                                For highly available and durable storage solutions, AWS offers Amazon Elastic File
                                System (EFS) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EFS provides a scalable and highly
                                available file system that can be mounted across multiple EC2 instances in different
                                AZs, while EBS offers persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2
                                instances, with built-in snapshot capabilities for data protection and disaster
                                recovery.

                                AWS also provides services for implementing disaster recovery strategies, such as AWS
                                Backup and AWS Site-to-Site VPN. AWS Backup enables you to centrally manage and automate
                                data backups across various AWS services, while Site-to-Site VPN allows you to securely
                                connect your on-premises infrastructure to your AWS environment, enabling hybrid
                                architectures and failover scenarios.

                                By leveraging these services and architectural patterns, you can design and implement
                                highly available and fault-tolerant applications on AWS. Whether you're building
                                mission-critical enterprise applications, e-commerce platforms, or real-time data
                                processing pipelines, AWS provides the tools and services necessary to ensure your
                                applications remain resilient, minimizing downtime and maximizing operational
                                efficiency.
